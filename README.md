### 📌 Featured Projects  

#### **NEST — Social Networking Microservice**
Flask microservice ecosystem using factory patterns, Blueprints, PostgreSQL, Socket.io, Docker, and Kubernetes (Minikube).  
Optimized DB schema → **20% faster query latency**.

#### **GraphCam — Image-to-Equation Engine**
AI system trained on **2,00,000+ images** to convert graphs → functional equations.  
Built preprocessing → model inference → post-processing pipeline.  
Frontend in React with predictable state management.

#### **Cattle Lens — Livestock Classification (Top-100 @ SIH out of 900)**
Built end-to-end CV pipeline using YOLO + ResNet18, achieving ~80% accuracy.  
Led a team of 6 using Agile.
